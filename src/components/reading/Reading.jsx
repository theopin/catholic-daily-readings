          Seek the LORD while he may be found,call him while he is near.Let the
          scoundrel forsake his way,and the wicked his thoughts;let him turn to
          the LORD for mercy;to our God, who is generous in forgiving.For my
          thoughts are not your thoughts,nor are your ways my ways, says the
          LORD.As high as the heavens are above the earth,so high are my ways
          above your waysand my thoughts above your thoughts.
