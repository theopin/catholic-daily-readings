              Seek the LORD while he may be found,call him while he is near.Let
              the scoundrel forsake his way,and the wicked his thoughts;let him
              turn to the LORD for mercy;to our God, who is generous in
              forgiving.For my thoughts are not your thoughts,nor are your ways
              my ways, says the LORD.As high as the heavens are above the
              earth,so high are my ways above your waysand my thoughts above
              your thoughts.

                Brothers and sisters:Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by
                life or by death. For to me life is Christ, and death is gain. If I
                go on living in the flesh,that means fruitful labor for me. And I do
                not know which I shall choose. I am caught between the two. I long
                to depart this life and be with Christ,for that is far better. Yet
                that I remain in the fleshis more necessary for your benefit.Only,
                conduct yourselves in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ.

              Jesus told his disciples this parable:"The kingdom of heaven is
              like a landownerwho went out at dawn to hire laborers for his
              vineyard. After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage,he
              sent them into his vineyard. Going out about nine o'clock,the
              landowner saw others standing idle in the marketplace,and he said
              to them, 'You too go into my vineyard,and I will give you what is
              just.'So they went off. And he went out again around noon,and
              around three o'clock, and did likewise. Going out about five
              o'clock,the landowner found others standing around, and said to
              them,'Why do you stand here idle all day?'They answered, 'Because
              no one has hired us.'He said to them, 'You too go into my
              vineyard.'When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to
              his foreman,'Summon the laborers and give them their pay,beginning
              with the last and ending with the first.'When those who had
              started about five o'clock came,each received the usual daily
              wage. So when the first came, they thought that they would receive
              more,but each of them also got the usual wage. And on receiving it
              they grumbled against the landowner, saying,'These last ones
              worked only one hour,and you have made them equal to us,who bore
              the day's burden and the heat.'He said to one of them in reply,'My
              friend, I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the
              usual daily wage? Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to
              give this last one the same as you? Or am I not free to do as I
              wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am
              generous?'Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be
              last.
